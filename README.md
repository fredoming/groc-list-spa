# groc-list-spa


## Requirements
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Angular CLI (v13)](https://angular.io/cli)

## Install
- Clone repo 
- Climb into the `grocery-list` and run `ng serve -o`
- Ensure you run the API along side with this. 

## Goals 
- ~~Use google OAuth as a login method and use tokens to gain access to the [.NET API](https://github.com/fredoming/groc-list-api)~~
- Use [@odata/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@odata/client) for easy odata queries. *Note this lib is not great with security and needs the odata endpoints to be open with no Auth! D: 
- Use a light weight css framework like [bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) to simplify element stylings and object to using material or boostrap! 
- ~~Use @angular/cdk to create custom overlayed components~~
